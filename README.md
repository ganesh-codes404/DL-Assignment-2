Roll No: 1601-22-737-176
**There is some sort of issue with the notebook of the 2nd Question, this is the notebook link( https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tdQ72kegxUVTS5BjlYDbN38qOwMCDUfM?usp=sharing )**

The Assignment has 2 questions, one deals with the Seq2Seq model to implement and train the model on the Dakshina Dataset, the other question deals with fine tuning the GPT-2 Model to generate lyrics(used HuggingFace to utilize the model)

## Question 1
For the first question, Dakshina Dataset has to be downloaded and then uploaded to the Google Drive and it can accessed from there by the following code:

```python 
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

file_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/dakshina_dataset_v1.0.tar' 
```
