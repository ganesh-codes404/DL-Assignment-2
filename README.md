# Dataset Preprocessing and Tokenization for Text Translation

This project demonstrates how to preprocess and tokenize a text dataset, preparing it for training a sequence-to-sequence model. The dataset is used for text translation tasks, and the code covers reading, cleaning, and converting the dataset into a format suitable for training machine learning models.

## Steps to Run the Code

### Step 1: Mount Google Drive
The first step is to mount Google Drive in Google Colab. This allows you to access the dataset stored on Google Drive and work with it directly in Colab.

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
